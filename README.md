# Chrismess

The first project for Xtern Bootcamp 2018 Session 3. This project uses vanilla JavaScript/ES2015+.

## Day 4 Homework

* Try the official [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Have a great weekend!

## Day 3 Homework

* In addition to building a list item and adding it to the DOM (as we are now), also store each flick in an array.

### Bonus Credit

* Add a _delete_ button to each list item that removes it from the list.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Remove the flick from the array as well.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting

* Add a _favorite_ button to each flick as well that lets you mark your favorites.
* Display favorites differently.
* Be sure the favorites are recorded appropriately in the array.

## Day 2 Homework

* Give the function `changeHeading` a more accurate name.
* Add a second field to the form.
* Display the value of that field in the list.

## Bonus Credit

* Display the second field in a separate HTML element than the flick name. For example:

```html
<li>
  <span class="flickName">Jurassic Work</span>
  <span class="year">2015</span>
</li>
```

* See if you can then style each field differently.

## Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Use more than one function. (Break `changeHeading` into multiple functions, as appropriate.)

## Day 1 Homework

* Make the button change the text of the heading (the `<h1>`).

### Bonus Credit

* Add multiple headings to the page, and make the button change the second one. (Use a `class` or an `id`.)

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Add a form to the page.
* Add a text input to the form.
* When the form is _submitted_, update the heading with the text that you type in the text input.

### Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting

* Make sure it works when you press _enter_ on the keyboard, not just when you click the button.
